## Problem Statement

All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the diwali 2023 and sankranti 2024 (festivals time in india) on their AtliQ branded products. Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.

Tony decided to give this work to Peter Pandey who is the curious Data Analyst of AtliQ Mart. Since these insights will be directly reported to the saless director, Tony also provided some notes to perer pandey to support his work.
